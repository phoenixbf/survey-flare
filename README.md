# Survey Add-on

This flare (plugin) for ATON adds a UI Survey profile for specific operations. It is being developed under [H2IOSC project](https://www.h2iosc.cnr.it/) as part of task 6.3 (E-RIHS WebXR services).


## Getting started

1) Follow [ATON framework instructions](https://github.com/phoenixbf/aton)
2) Just git clone or place "survey" folder inside `/Your-ATON-folder/config/flares/` thus obtaining: `/Your-ATON-folder/config/flares/survey/`
3) When loading a 3D scene with Hathor, it adds survey profile to the list
